# Containerlab EDA Connector Tool

Integrate your [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) topology seamlessly with [EDA (Event-Driven Automation)](https://docs.eda.dev) to streamline network automation and management.

## Overview

There are two primary methods to create and experiment with network functions provided by EDA:

1. **Real Hardware:** Offers robust and reliable performance but can be challenging to acquire and maintain, especially for large-scale setups.
2. **Sandbox System:** Highly flexible and cost-effective but limited in adding secondary containers like authentication servers or establishing external connectivity.

[Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) bridges these gaps by providing an elegant solution for network emulation using container-based topologies. This tool enhances your Containerlab experience by automating the onboarding process into EDA, ensuring a smooth and efficient integration.

## ðŸš¨ Important Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **EDA Installation Mode:** This tool **requires EDA to be installed with `Simulate=False`**. Ensure that your EDA deployment is configured accordingly.
>
> **Hardware License:** A valid **`hardware license` for EDA version 24.12.0** is mandatory for using this connector tool.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Containerlab EDA Connector tool, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **EDA Setup:**
  - Installed without simulation (`Simulate=False`).
  - Contains a valid `hardware license` for version 24.12.0.
- **Network Connectivity:**
  - EDA nodes can ping the Containerlab's management IP.
- **Containerlab:**
  - You need at latest containerlab version `v0.61.0`
  - Environment var `CLAB_EDA_MODE=1` needs to bet set
- **kubectl:**
  - You must have `kubectl` installed and configured to connect to the same Kubernetes cluster that is running EDA. The connector will use `kubectl apply` in the background to create the necessary `Artifact` resources.

> [!TIP]
> **Network Connectivity between Kind and Containerlab:**
>
> If you're running EDA in KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) and Containerlab on the same host, you need to allow communication between containerlab and kind docker networks:
>
> ```bash
> sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER 2 \
> -o $(sudo docker network inspect kind -f '{{.Id}}' | cut -c 1-12 | awk '{print "br-"$1}') \
> -m comment --comment "allow communications to kind bridge" -j ACCEPT
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Proxy Settings:** This tool does not utilize the system's proxy (`$http_proxy`) variables. Instead, it provides optional arguments to specify HTTP and HTTPS proxies for communicating with EDA.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Containerlab EDA Connector tool:

> [!TIP]
> Using a virtual environment is recommended to avoid version conflicts with global Python packages.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv/
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Upgrade pip:**

    ```
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

4. **Install Required Python Modules:**

    ```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Verify Installation:**

    ```
    python eda_containerlab_connector.py --help
    ```

## Usage

The tool offers two primary subcommands: `integrate` and `remove`.

### Integrate Containerlab with EDA

Integrate your Containerlab topology into EDA:

```
python eda_containerlab_connector.py integrate \
    --topology-file path/to/topology.yaml \
    --eda-url https://eda.example.com \
    --eda-user admin \
    --eda-password yourpassword \
    --http-proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080 \
    --https-proxy https://proxy.example.com:8443 \
    --verify
```

### Remove Containerlab Integration from EDA

Remove the previously integrated Containerlab topology from EDA:

```
python eda_containerlab_connector.py remove \
    --topology-file path/to/topology.yaml \
    --eda-url https://eda.example.com \
    --eda-user admin \
    --eda-password yourpassword
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Logging Levels:** Use the `--log-level` flag to set the desired logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). For example, `--log-level DEBUG` provides detailed logs for troubleshooting.

### Example Command

```
python eda_containerlab_connector.py integrate -t example-topology.yaml -e https://eda.example.com -u admin -p adminpassword -l INFO
```
